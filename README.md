# A Comprehensive Review on Hashtag Recommendation: From Traditional to Deep Learning and Beyond
The exponential growth of user-generated content on social media platforms has precipitated significant challenges in information management, particularly in content organization, retrieval, and discovery. Hashtags, as a fundamental categorization mechanism, play a pivotal role in enhancing content visibility and user engagement. However, the development of accurate and robust hashtag recommendation systems remains a complex and evolving research challenge. Existing surveys in this domain are limited in scope and recency, focusing narrowly on specific platforms (X and Sina Weibo), methodologies, or timeframes. To address this gap, this review article conducts a systematic analysis of hashtag recommendation systems, comprehensively examining recent advancements across several dimensions. Serving as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners, this work aims to catalyze innovation in social media content organization, thereby advancing user experience and driving innovation in social media content management and discovery.
